I'm an Atmospheric Engineer at [Tomorrow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io/).  

I'm interested in solving problems, particularly involving [air pollution](https://www.lukeconibear.com/airpollution.html), [Python](https://www.lukeconibear.com/swd6_hpp/), [numerical atmospheric models](https://wrfchem-leeds.github.io/WRFotron/), and [machine learning](https://www.lukeconibear.com/intro_ml/).
